## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Android Studio with AVD (for Android)
- Xcode (for iOS, macOS only)

> Native modules (WatermelonDB, MMKV) require a **dev build**. `pnpm start` with Expo Go will not work.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate native projects (first time or after native dep changes)
pnpm prebuild

# Run
pnpm android    # Android
pnpm ios        # iOS (macOS only)
```

### Useful commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm lint` | Biome lint check |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Lint and auto-fix |
| `pnpm types` | TypeScript type check |
| `pnpm structure` | Regenerate docs/STRUCTURE.md |
| `pnpm check-i18n-keys` | Find missing translation keys |

**Pre-commit hook** (husky): runs `pnpm structure` → `pnpm lint:fix` → `pnpm types` automatically. All three must pass.
