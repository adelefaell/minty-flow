 * | `categories:dirty` | A category is mutated or its `transaction_count` changes |
 * | `tags:dirty` | A tag is mutated or its `transaction_count` changes |
 * | `budgets:dirty` | A budget or its join rows change |
 * | `goals:dirty` | A goal or its join rows change |
 * | `loans:dirty` | A loan is mutated |
 * | `transfers:dirty` | A transfer row is written or deleted |
 * | `recurring_transactions:dirty` | A recurring template is mutated |
